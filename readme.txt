This supplemental material first describes the correct patches generated by ARJA for 18 real bugs from Defects4J. We would like to explain why these patches are correct. Then, for each of the 10 repair algorithms in comparison, we list which bugs in Defects4J are
repaired (in terms of satisfying the test suite).
